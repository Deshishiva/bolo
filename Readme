Bolo Assignment:

This project is a prototype built for the BoloForms assignment to demonstrate reliable placement of signature fields from a browser into a static PDF document.

The focus of this assignment is solving the coordinate mismatch between responsive browser layouts (top-left, pixels) and PDF documents (bottom-left, points).

What’s Implemented:

1.Signature field placement on a document in the browser

2.Relative (percentage-based) coordinate storage for responsiveness

3.Backend conversion of browser coordinates to PDF coordinates

4.Signature burned into the PDF without distortion

5.SHA-256 hash generated before and after signing

6.Signed PDF returned and opened in a new tab

Tech Used:
1.React + Vite
2.Node.js + Express
3.pdf-lib

How to Run:

Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm start

Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

Note:
This is a functional prototype focused on correctness of logic and explainability rather than UI polish or full production features.
