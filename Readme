Bolo Assignment:

This project is a prototype built for the BoloForms assignment to demonstrate reliable placement of signature fields from a browser into a static PDF document.

The focus of this assignment is solving the coordinate mismatch between responsive browser layouts (top-left, pixels) and PDF documents (bottom-left, points).

What’s Implemented

Signature field placement on a document in the browser

Relative (percentage-based) coordinate storage for responsiveness

Backend conversion of browser coordinates to PDF coordinates

Signature burned into the PDF without distortion

SHA-256 hash generated before and after signing

Signed PDF returned and opened in a new tab

Tech Used

React + Vite

Node.js + Express

pdf-lib

How to Run
Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm start

Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

Note

This is a functional prototype focused on correctness of logic and explainability rather than UI polish or full production features.
